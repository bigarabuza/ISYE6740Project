# Steam Game Recommender System

This repository shows our analysis over Steam game data. The dataset was retrived [here](https://steam.internet.byu.edu/). 

Our detailed analysis is outlined in the [Analysis.ipnyb file](https://github.gatech.edu/bigarabuza3/ISYE6740Project/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb). 

We use SK Learn's Nearest Neighbors algorithm to generate game recommendations for users.
